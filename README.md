<p align="center">A free and open-source SMS/Call Spamming Tool</p>

## NOTE:


> **Due to the overuse of script, a bunch of APIs have been taken offline. It is okay if you do not receive all the messages.**

- For best performance, use single thread with considerable delay time
- Always ensure that you are using the latest version of TBomb and have Python 3
- This application must not be used to cause harm/discomfort/trouble to others
- By using this, you agree that you cannot hold the contributors responsible for any misuse
